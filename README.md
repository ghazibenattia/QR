## My process
As I'm just getting started as a frontend developer with no coding background whatsover, I was struggling at the beggining of this project but then as I got familiarized with using HTML and CSS it started getting easier. 
This project took me almost 5 hours and I'm proud of the progress I achieved.

### What I learned
From working on this project, I learned the following key skills:
1. HTML5 Structure: I learned how to use semantic HTML5 elements to create a well-structured webpage (e.g., <header>, <footer>, <section>).
2. External CSS Linking: I learned how to link external stylesheets and organize my styles separately from the HTML content.
3. Responsive Design: I gained experience using flexbox and other CSS techniques to create layouts that adjust to different screen sizes, making the site mobile-friendly.
4. Typography & Google Fonts: I learned how to import and apply custom fonts from Google Fonts to improve the visual appearance of text.
5. CSS Styling: I applied properties like box-shadow, border-radius, and HSL color values to enhance the design with modern aesthetics.
6. User Interactivity: I added hover effects on links to improve user experience and engagement.
7. Visual Design Principles: I learned how to balance spacing, margins, and alignment to create a clean and readable design.

### Continued development
For continued development, I plan to focus on refining my skills in responsive design, particularly in using Flexbox and CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
I also aim to deepen my understanding of advanced CSS techniques, such as animations and transitions, to enhance user interactivity. Additionally, I want to explore JavaScript integration for dynamic functionality and further improve my familiarity with web accessibility principles to ensure my projects are inclusive.
These areas will help me create even more polished and user-friendly websites in future projects.
